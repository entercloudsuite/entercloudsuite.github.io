6. Pick a flavor to define the virtual hardware specifications (CPU, RAM and HDD) of your instance.  
**Note: if you are exceeding your configured quotas, some flavors may be grayed out accordingly.**

7. Select an image to boot your instance from: this is the software template you are going to use to run your instance. May be a standard template provided by Enter (e.g. Ubuntu Linux or Windows 2008R2) or a snapshot previously taken from a user's instance.

#### That's it!

You're ready to proceed and click "Launch Instance". It will take around 10 seconds before your instance will be available for logon (a bit more if you chose a snapshot as an image).

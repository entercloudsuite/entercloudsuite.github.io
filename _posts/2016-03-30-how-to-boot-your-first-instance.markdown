1. Log into the <a href="https://dashboard.entercloudsuite.com" target="_blank">Enter Cloud Suite Dashboard</a>.

2. Click on **Computing > Instances** on the left menu.

3. Click on **Launch instance** on top right of the screen.

4. Choose a name for the instance you will launch.

6. Pick a flavor to define the virtual hardware specifications (CPU, RAM and HD) of your instance.

7. Select the image you want your instance to be booted from: this is the software template you are going to use on it. It could be a standard template provided by Enter (e.g. Ubuntu Linux or Windows 2012), a snapshot previously taken from an existing instance or an image uploaded by yourself.

8. Define if the instance shall be provisioned with a public IP or with a private IP for LAN use only.
**Note: if you didn't provision a router or a network (LAN or subnet) inside your tenant, ECS will configure it for you. If you have already created a single network with a single LAN, the system will pick the existing one automatically, and if there is more than one network you will be prompted to choose the one you want.**

9. Choose the public SSH key you are going to use to administer your instance: import one from your computer, create a new keypair or select an existing one. Should you choose to create a new keypair, you will be prompted to download the private key once you click on "Launch instance".

10. Schedule automated backups for your instance: this feature allows you to plan periodic snapshots.

#### That's it!

You're ready to go on, so click "Launch Instance". It will take around 10 seconds before your instance will be available for logon (Windows instances take a bit longer).
